Description: This package is used to create a linear model by supplying the formula and dataset. The model is calculated using least squares and returns an object of class RC. Within the object you can call the following methods to analyze your model;
print(): to print out coefficients and coefficient names
plot(): plot residuals vs fitted and scale-location plots based on
        ggplot2 graphics
resid(): return the residuals as a vector
pred(): return the predicted values of y
coef(): return the model coefficients as a named vector
summary(): return a cohesive printout involving coefficients with
        standard error, t-value, p-value, estimated standard deviation
        and df

Since we have built the ridge regression based on the API data from Lab 5, downloading that package - which is called BaDaAn and linked below - is required.

- Step to download the package:
install_github("wountoto/Lab5_AdvR", subdir = "BaDaAn", build_vignettes = TRUE)
install_github("Johhed15/Lab4_R", subdir = "linmod", build_vignettes = TRUE)


- Further steps on how to use the package can be seen via the Vignettes. To call the vignettes: 

browseVignettes("linmod")

We have created 3 separate vignettes to make it easier to review each one. 

- The different assignments from the bonus lab has been added to this repository.
